## POAP Invites Frame
Create an invite frame to add users to a channel on Farcaster from a POAP event.

This project uses frog.fm in nextjs to create and host the frame server, fetches POAP data from poap.tech, and finds fc users using Neynar SDK. Created at Devcon 2024.

Uses https://github.com/iSpeakNerd/cast-intent to cast frame into channel.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Head to http://localhost:3000/api/dev to inspect frame
